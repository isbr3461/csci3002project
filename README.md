# csci3002project
Our project is a 3D modeling software with an attatched tangible interface. It uses a sandbox that has a projecter to display a heightmap on top of it, in which the sand can be manipulated to create hills, valleys, etc. The user can then take this creation and export a generated file  into a form compatible with 3D modeling software, so they can edit it futher. The purpose of this project is to add a physical aspect to 3D modeling, when working with extremely large terrain or very small terrain, so everyone can contribute, even those without in depth modeling knowledge or a very strong computer. 

Our process was very simple, us both writing the summary for the respective people we interviewed for the requirements gathering portion. We met to brainstorm, equally contributing important points. Isabelle typed the notes while Kartik typed the discussion results. We both created the final design summary. We also worked on the prototype equally, Isabelle working on the 'Edit sandbox' portion and part of the 'import design into an already created project' user tasks, and Kartik working on the 'creating a new project' and the rest of the 'import design into an already created project' user tasks. I(Isabelle) am now typing up this README document.
